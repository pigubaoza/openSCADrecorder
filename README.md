This is a project done for the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Computational Fabrication module. 
Its aim is to create a parametric recorder attachment to allow a user to play different keys/modes by simply changing this attachment. 
The Python code generates an OpenSCAD code that can be pasted into OpenSCAD to visualize the model, convert it to .stl, and print it. 
The Python libraries used are SolidPython, and can be found here: https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython
The equations are based on the widely available Bernade Equations. 

While this project is abandoned temporarily, any work on it is welcome. The code only supports 6-hole recorders. This can be extended to more holes, and even to flutes. The hole sizes are not automatically optimized for playing two octaves based on the cutoff frequency and work can be done here.
